#BlackJack Project

*Basic BlackJack game to simulate active choices by the user and automated responses from the dealer, running until the deck is exhausted by the dealer. 

**The dealer always hits on hands adding up to 16, and stops if the hand is still below 21. The player automatically wins if the dealer goes over 21. 

**The player always has a choice to hit or stay. Their turn ultimately ends when they hold or their hand exceed 21. The player automatically wins if they hit 21. 

**Finally, if both player and dealer end on an equal hand, the hand "pushes" and it results in a tie. 

**The program must be re-run after each round. 

*Difficulties - tracking each, object, their methods, method calls, constructors and assignments was by far the most difficult part of this project. 

**Adding values to the cards wasn't difficult, but calling the proper getValue() method was difficult. 
**Ace was assigned a value of 1. Future iterations of the program will include ways for the program to calculate best value of the ace's worth based on current hand

*Comments
**In-program comments were generally left in for me to go back and study the logic.
